# blocker.1


export interface OsUnixSocatServiceUnit {
  serviceName: string;
  fromHost: string;
  fromPort: number;
  intoHost: string;
  intoPort: number;
}

this service unit interface uses our declarative terms

instead, it should use the exact types of the sdk; i.e., the exact terms that the OS talks about these attributes in

we'll cast into our own terms at the cast layer

dont forget to add comments for each attribute too; explain what they are and why; add citations and links to docs


# blocker.2


export interface OsUnixHostsFileLine {
  ip: string;
  hostnames: string[];
  comment?: string;
  isManagedByDeclastruct: boolean;
}

same here;

for example `isManagedByDeclastruct` is not an attribute that the Os would implement; these types should match the os level exactly, sine they're the SDK via which we interface with the OS

our implementation specific details build upon the fundamental truth, the interface the os provides, to add our own control over it at the src/domain.* layer

in the access/sdk layer, the purpose is to be as true to reality as possible; no usecase specific considerations, only the truth of what is exposed by the OS
